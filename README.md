# Workshop Brief/specification

The divide in social methods isn’t just between quantitative and qualitative, but also between case-based and variable-based. Most quantitative research is variable-based, and most qualitative research is case-based. But it doesn’t have to be this way. 

This workshop will cross these streams, showing how case-based quantitative research can be conducted using Lexis surfaces. Lexis surfaces are surfaces of population data – any kind of data about people that’s reported by both age and year – and allow thousands of pieces of data to turned into complex three dimensional data surfaces. These surfaces can either be drawn on screens like standard maps, or be represented more directly using both 3D graphics engines and 3D printing. 

Lexis surfaces mean that large amounts of data, showing how events over the life course have changed over many generations, can be explored and understood by researchers with any kind of background. No prior knowledge of quantitative methods is required. 

The workshop will cover two of the main types of data used in population analysis: mortality data, and fertility data. 

The morning session will focus on mortality data, and introduce the approach and key intuitions, using 3D printed Lexis surfaces (‘Lexis Cubes’) alongside two additional map-based Lexis surface visualisations: the Shaded Level Plot for exploring within a population, and the Comparative Level Plot for comparing between populations. 

The afternoon session will focus on fertility data, and introduce an extension of the Lexis surface approach, the Composite Fertility Lattice Plot (CFLP), which visualises complex patterns of fertility change in 45 countries in a single image. 
Both sessions will be highly interactive and involve many group-based activities.

--------------------------

# Morning Session: Mortality

The morning session will focus on mortality data, and within this mainly on all-cause mortality data from the [Human Mortality Database](http://www.mortality.org/) (HMD).

The morning session will start with [this presentation](https://github.com/JonMinton/sgsss_workshop/blob/master/presentation_am.html). 

After the presentation, participants will be presented with the following examples of Lexis surfaces:

* [All cause mortality](https://github.com/JonMinton/sgsss_workshop/tree/master/figures) for all available HMD countries. These are available [here](https://github.com/JonMinton/sgsss_workshop/blob/master/figures/mortality_gridded.pdf) with gridded guidelines demarcating ages, years and cohorts by decade, and in an ungridded form [here](https://github.com/JonMinton/sgsss_workshop/blob/master/figures/mortality_ungridded.pdf). 
* A [one page brief](https://github.com/JonMinton/sgsss_workshop/blob/master/support/mortality/Jon%20Minton%20-%20Scotland%20as%20Sick%20Man%20Brief.docx) on comparative mortality, comparing Scotland with average mortality risks for different European regions.
* An A3 presentation giving cause-specific mortality for different gender/ethnic groups in the USA since 1999, produced using [Center for Disease Control](https://wonder.cdc.gov/) data.
* Some examples of [3D printed mortality data](https://github.com/JonMinton/Statistical_Sculpture/tree/master/stl/individual/lmorts) also produced using the HMD. 

The aim of the morning session will be, using these materials, to work in groups to develop a series of short presentations to be given before lunch. 

--------------------

# Afternoon Session: Fertility

The afternoon session will focus on a particular methodological refinement of the standard Lexis surface, as applied to fertility rather than mortality data. The session will start with a [presentation](https://github.com/JonMinton/sgsss_workshop/blob/master/presentation/comparative_fertility_presentation.pptx) I delivered previously which describes the approach, and makes some suggestions about possible implications of the findings. After this, two additional materials will be presented: 

* [A paper](https://osf.io/fruhz/) describing the approach and literature/academic debates which the research links to, co-authored with Serena Pattaro and Laura Vanderbloemen.
* The [full visualisation](https://github.com/JonMinton/comparative_fertility/blob/master/figures/ccfr/hfd_hfc_combined_latticeplot.png), comprising fertility trajectories by cohort for 45 countries. 

Additional figures, for each individual country, are available [here](https://github.com/JonMinton/sgsss_workshop/tree/master/figures/fertility/individual) and, with different aethetics, [here](https://github.com/JonMinton/comparative_fertility/tree/master/figures).

As with the morning session, the aim of the afternoon session will be to work in groups, using the materials to produce a series of short presentations to be given at the end of the day.

# Going further 

The aim of the workshop is to be accessible for everyone, regardless of technical background. However, for those with a technical background the R code used to produce all visualisations, and perform all data management and tidying work required to produce the visualisations, is freely available on Github, with the majority of the links provided in this repository.
