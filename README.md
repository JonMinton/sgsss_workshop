# Workshop Brief/specification

The divide in social methods isn’t just between quantitative and qualitative, but also between case-based and variable-based. Most quantitative research is variable-based, and most qualitative research is case-based. But it doesn’t have to be this way. 

This workshop will cross these streams, showing how case-based quantitative research can be conducted using Lexis surfaces. Lexis surfaces are surfaces of population data – any kind of data about people that’s reported by both age and year – and allow thousands of pieces of data to turned into complex three dimensional data surfaces. These surfaces can either be drawn on screens like standard maps, or be represented more directly using both 3D graphics engines and 3D printing. 

Lexis surfaces mean that large amounts of data, showing how events over the life course have changed over many generations, can be explored and understood by researchers with any kind of background. No prior knowledge of quantitative methods is required. 

The workshop will cover two of the main types of data used in population analysis: mortality data, and fertility data. 

The morning session will focus on mortality data, and introduce the approach and key intuitions, using 3D printed Lexis surfaces (‘Lexis Cubes’) alongside two additional map-based Lexis surface visualisations: the Shaded Level Plot for exploring within a population, and the Comparative Level Plot for comparing between populations. 

The afternoon session will focus on fertility data, and introduce an extension of the Lexis surface approach, the Composite Fertility Lattice Plot (CFLP), which visualises complex patterns of fertility change in 45 countries in a single image. 
Both sessions will be highly interactive and involve many group-based activities.

# Morning Session: Mortality

The morning session will focus on mortality data, and within this mainly on all-cause mortality data from the [Human Mortality Database](http://www.mortality.org/) (HMD).

The morning session will start with [this presentation](https://github.com/JonMinton/sgsss_workshop/blob/master/presentation_am.html). 

After the presentation, participants will be presented with the following examples of Lexis surfaces:

* [All cause mortality](https://github.com/JonMinton/sgsss_workshop/tree/master/figures) for all available HMD countries. 
* A [one page brief](https://github.com/JonMinton/sgsss_workshop/blob/master/support/mortality/Jon%20Minton%20-%20Scotland%20as%20Sick%20Man%20Brief.docx) on comparative mortality, comparing Scotland with average mortality risks for different European regions.
* An A3 presentation giving cause-specific mortality for different gender/ethnic groups in the USA since 1999, produced using [Center for Disease Control](https://wonder.cdc.gov/) data.
* Some examples of [3D printed mortality data](https://github.com/JonMinton/Statistical_Sculpture/tree/master/stl/individual/lmorts) also produced using the HMD.
